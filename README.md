# CalCOFI Oceanographic Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) dataset, which represents one of the longest and most complete time series of oceanographic and larval fish data in the world.

## 📋 Introduction
The analysis aims to investigate the relationship between water temperature, water salinity, and other factors such as water depth using data collected by CalCOFI. 

It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and evaluation of the predictive performance of the model.

## 🗃️ Dataset
The CalCOFI dataset consists of various oceanographic parameters such as water temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, and more, collected at regular time and space intervals since 1949.

The dataset used in this analysis can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi).

## 🌱 Getting Started
To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   `https://github.com/ShaharBand/CalCOFI_Oceanographic_Analysis.git`
   
2. Install the required libraries:
   `pip install requirements.txt`
   
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `CalCOFI_Oceanographic_Analysis.ipynb` to view the analysis steps and code.

## 📊 Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the relationship between water temperature, salinity, and other oceanographic parameters. 

By understanding these relationships, we can better understand the dynamics of the California Current and its impact on marine life.
